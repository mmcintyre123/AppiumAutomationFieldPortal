To do:

	> create delete volunteer test.
	> create all tests for inactive_vols as for active_vols.
	> write sql to remove volunteers with no names
	> Fix login_counts_homescreen_final.js reactivatedcount - needs to take into account volunteer history.  If volunteer was previously reactivated, making them inactive again will turn BACK the reactivatedcount i.e. reduce it by 1.  After saving the volunteer info (whichever one is on top), could query sql to see if they had been previously inactive, and if so, update the reactivatedcount accordingly when we deactivate them.

	> move project to bitbucket so we can make it private so I can add queries.js to version control.
	> check the volunteer history messages in volunteer details update in active_vols.js and inactive_vols.js
	> Compare Android and iOS accessibility IDs and file issues in 33042.

Create more tests cases:

	Login
	4) Email Active Volunteer, verify volunteer history
	5) Text Active Volunteer, verify volunteer history

	done	In login counts test create objects for each count - should persist across all test sessions.
	done	update the objects during testing:
	done		- anytime we add a volunteer => active += 1, volBase += 1
	done		- activate someone from inactive => re-activated += 1, active volunteers += 1, inactive -= 1
				- mark a volunteer inactive => active -= 1, inactive += 1
	done	At the end of testing verify counts with both sql and expected counts from updated objects.

	> everywhere we check for elements to be present/absent in a list, must assert the element is visible/invisible -- element may not appear, but it is still there, only hidden.  So we can't verify an element is present based on it's id - must make sure the "visible" attribute is true.
	> State selection - figure out how to scroll
	> Anytime we have a long wait statement, be sure to time the action.

Add to walk project:
	> modify wait_for_sql in walk project to match this.
	> update sql queries in walk project to set connection conditionally for test vs. prod

Notes:
	// Keep tests short (less than 6 minutes) and log out and back in
	// in future research if possible to pass in database to query for sql queries, like using :setvar
	// can use clip package to access clipboard: 			
		let clip = require('clipboardy');
		clip.writeSync('VA') // put state on clipboard
	// Had to set user id, name and database name in the login step, and make all queries dynamically set the current database before they run
